# Test

-----

1. Undefined. Because when we declare a
 variable through the keywords "var" variable is
 created before code execution and in this example we call variable
 before we put anything into it, it will return undefined.
 
2. task-2.js 
3. task-3.js 
4. task-4.js
5. 
    ```
    $(".articles .node");
    $(".articles > .node");
    $(".articles").children(".node");
    $(".articles").find(".node");
    ```
6. task-6.js task-6.html
7. I recommend to run AJAX request when component connected, DOM elements already on page and do this in component componentDidMount().
   Because when DOM already a can change structure immediately.
8. When we click on first button we won't get anything because this function completed during 
   initialization.

    When we click on second button we won't get anything because this function not context bound.
    
    When we click on third and fourth button it will work and we get 'This is an example text.'
